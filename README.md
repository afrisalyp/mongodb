# Introduction

MongoDB is a high-performance, open source, schema-free document-oriented
data store that's easy to deploy, manage and use.
It's network accessible, written in C++ and offers the following features:

- Collection oriented storage - easy storage of object-style data
- Full index support, including on inner objects
- Query profiling
- Replication and fail-over support
- Efficient storage of binary data including large objects (e.g. videos)
- Auto-sharding for cloud-level scalability (Q209) High performance,
  scalability, and  reasonable depth of functionality are the goals for
  the project.  This is a metapackage that depends on all the mongodb parts.


# Review the configurable options

        description: Number of backups to keep. Keeps one week's worth by default.

### Where:

- replicaset
   - ie: myreplicaset
   - Each replicaset has a unique name to distinguish it’s members from other replicasets available in the network.
   - The default value of myset should be fine for most single cluster scenarios.

- web_admin_ui
   - MongoDB comes with a basic but very informative web user interface that provides health
     and status information on the database node as well as the cluster.
   - The default value of yes will start the Admin web UI on port 28017.

- replicaset_master
   - If this node is going to be joining an existing replicaset, you can specify a member of that cluster
     ( preferably the master node ) so we can join the existing replicaset.
   - The value should be in the form of host[:port]
   - ie:  hostname ( will connect to hostname on the default port of 27017 )
   - ie:  hostname:port  ( will connect to hostname on port number <port> )

Most of the options in config.yaml have been modeled after the default configuration file for mongodb (normally in /etc/mongodb.conf) and should be familiar to most mongodb admins.  Each option in this charm have a brief description of what it does.


# Deployment

## Single Node


Deploy the first MongoDB instance

    juju deploy mongodb
    juju expose mongodb

## Replica Sets

Deploy the first MongoDB instance

    juju deploy mongodb
    juju expose mongodb

Your deployment should look similar to this ( juju status ):

    machines:
     0:
            dns-name: ec2-50-19-46-207.compute-1.amazonaws.com
            instance-id: i-3817fc5a
            instance-state: running
            state: running
     1:
            dns-name: ec2-50-17-73-255.compute-1.amazonaws.com
            instance-id: i-90c822f2
            instance-state: running
            state: running
    services:
     mongodb:
            charm: local:oneiric/mongodb-17
            exposed: true
            relations:
             replica-set: mongodb
            units:
             mongodb/0:
               machine: 1
               open-ports:
               - 27017/tcp
               - 28017/tcp
               public-address: ec2-50-17-73-255.compute-1.amazonaws.com
               relations:
                 replica-set:
                   state: up
               state: started

In addition, the MongoDB web interface should also be accessible via the services’
public-address and port 28017 ( ie: http://ec2-50-17-73-255.compute-1.amazonaws.com:28017 ).

### (Optional)Change the replicaset name

    juju set mongodb replicaset=<new_replicaset_name>

### Add one more nodes to your replicaset

    juju add-unit mongodb


### Add multiple nodes to your replicaset

    juju add-unit mongodb -n5


We now have a working MongoDB replica-set.


## Sharding

According the the mongodb documentation found on their website (http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/deploy-shard-cluster/), one way of deploying a Shard Cluster is as follows:

- deploy config servers
- deploy a mongo shell (mongos)
- deploy shards
- connect the config servers to the mongo shell
- add the shards to the mongo shell


Using Juju we can deploy a sharded cluster using the following commands:

### Prepare a configuration file similar to the following:
    shard1:
      replicaset: shard1
    shard2:
      replicaset: shard2
    shard3:
      replicaset: shard3
    configsvr:
      replicaset: configsvr
We'll save this one as ~/mongodb-shard.yaml
  

### Bootstrap the environment
    juju bootstrap

### Config Servers ( we'll deploy 3 of them )
    juju deploy mongodb configsvr --config ~/mongodb-shard.yaml -n3

### Mongo Shell ( We just deploy one for now )
    juju deploy mongodb mongos

### Shards ( We'll deploy three replica-sets )
    juju deploy mongodb shard1 --config ~/mongodb-shard.yaml -n3
    juju deploy mongodb shard2 --config ~/mongodb-shard.yaml -n3
    juju deploy mongodb shard3 --config ~/mongodb-shard.yaml -n3

### Connect the Config Servers to the Mongo shell (mongos)
    juju add-relation mongos:mongos-cfg configsvr:configsvr

### Connect each Shard to the Mongo shell (mongos)
    juju add-relation mongos:mongos shard1:database
    juju add-relation mongos:mongos shard2:database
    juju add-relation mongos:mongos shard3:database

With the above commands, we should now have a three replica-set sharded cluster running.
Using the default configuration, here are some details of our sharded cluster:
- mongos is running on port 27021
- configsvr is running on port 27019
- the shards are running on the default mongodb port of 27017
- The web admin is turned on by default and accessible with your browser on port 28017 on each of the shards.

To verify that your sharded cluster is running, connect to the mongo shell and run sh.status():
- mongo --host <mongos_host>:<mongos_port>
- run sh.status()
You should see your the hosts for your shards in the status output.

### Use the storage subordinate to store mongodb data on a permanent OpenStack or Amazon EBS volume

The [storage](http://manage.jujucharms.com/charms/precise/storage) subordinate and [block-storage-broker](http://manage.jujucharms.com/charms/precise/block-storage-broker) service can automatically handle attaching the volume and mounting it to the unit before MongoDB is setup to use it.

For example if you've created the volumes `vol-id-00001` and `vol-id-00002` and want to attach them to your 2 mongo units, with your OpenStack or AWS credentials in a `credential.yaml` file:

    juju deploy block-storage-broker --config credentials.yaml
    juju deploy storage
    juju add-relation block-storage-broker storage
    juju set storage provider=block-storage-broker
    juju set volume_map="{mongodb/0: vol-id-00001, mongodb/1: vol-id-00002}"
    juju add-relation storage mongodb


### Use a permanent Openstack volume to store mongodb data. (DEPRECATED)

**Note**: Although these steps will still work they are now deprecated, you should use the storage subordinate above instead.

To deploy mongodb using permanent volume on Openstack, the permanent volume should be attached to the mongodb unit just after the deployment, then the configuration should be updated like follows.

    juju set mongodb volume-dev-regexp="/dev/vdc" volume-map='{"mongodb/0": "vol-id-00000000000000"}' volume-ephemeral-storage=false

## Backups

Backups can be enabled via config. Note that destroying the service cannot
currently remove the backup cron job so it will continue to run. There is a
setting for the number of backups to keep, however, to prevent from filling
disk space.

To fetch the backups scp the files down from the path in the config.


# Troubleshooting

- If your master/slave/replicaset deployment is not updating correctly, check the log files at /var/log/mongodb/mongodb.log to see if there is an obvious reason ( port not open etc.).
- Ensure that TCP port 27017 is accessible from all of the nodes in the deployment.
- If you are trying to access your MongoDB instance from outside your deployment, ensure that the service has been exposed ( juju expose mongodb )
- Make sure that the mongod process is running ( ps -ef | grep mongo ).
- Try restarting the database ( restart mongodb )
- If all else fails, remove the data directory on the slave ( rm -fr /var/log/mongodb/data/* ) and restart the mongodb-slave daemon ( restart mongodb ).
- The MongoDB website ( http://www.mongodb.org ) has a very good documentation section ( http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Home )
